![Gradio-Based User Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bd3b766-7041-499b-87c8-fefcaa3dfd20)

VaultMind is a machine learning-powered tool designed to predict bankruptcy in SMEs using financial data. It combines high accuracy with interpretability through a Gradio-based interface.

This repository provides a bankruptcy prediction tool for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), aiming to provide interpretable results through a user-friendly interface. The ensemble model outperforms traditional methods, achieving high reliability in financial distress prediction.

## üîç Core Features:

* **Ensemble Model**: Combines Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost (Voting Classifier) achieving **96.63% accuracy** and **99.6% ROC AUC**.
* **Explainability**: Uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to highlight key financial ratios influencing predictions.
* **Narrative Reports**: Generates human-readable summaries using **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**.
